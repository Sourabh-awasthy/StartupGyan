      not surprised of the result though it had been very pleasant news. He didn’t <br>
      feel intimidated by exams and while at the examination centre, he felt fully confident and sure
      <br>
      about his preparations. Sandeep spent 12-14 hours preparing for his JEE Advanced and according br
      <br>
      to him JEE Mains were not really his concern area. <br>
      Along with JEE, Sandeep also topped EAMCET examination. He appeared for EAMCET to keep it just
      <br>
      as an option and his preparations for EAMCET began only 1 week prior to the examinations. He <br>
      felt that the EAMCET syllabus was not as difficult as the JEE and maths being his forte from the
      <br> childhood days, made his journey towards EAMCET easier. Sandeep always wanted to crack
      <br>
      through the JEE since his high school days but he says that he became serious towards his goal <br>
      only after class 10. Sandeep scored 98% in school exams as well!
    </p>
    <h3>A. Ravi Chandra </h3>
    <p>
      JEE Advanced AIR 2 <br>
      It is a sheer wonder that both the toppers of JEE Advanced 2013 are not just from the same
      <br>
      state, Andhra Pradesh, but from the same coaching institute as well. A. Ravi Chandra even said
      <br>
      that he and Sandeep sometimes even used to study together. Ravi, from his class 11 days
      <br>
      expected to bag a rank in the top 10 of JEE Advanced rankers, but he was delighted and
      <br>
      pleasantly surprised to be the second topper. <br>
      IIT Advanced was on Ravi’s mind since class 11 and he was determined towards his goal.
      <br>
      According to Ravi, Andhra State board syllabus is very tough but the JEE depth is greater.
      <br>
      Ravi started studying for his state board exams only a month prior to the board examination.
    </p>
    <h3>Anand Bharoskar </h3>
    <p>
      JEE Advanced AIR 3 <br>
      Anand Bharoskar was on top of the world with the JEE results being out last year. He would have been happy had 
      <br>
      he got any rank within the top 100, but being rank 3 was completely unexpected for him. A candidate from  
      <br>
      Indore, Anand started preparing for JEE from class 11 and enrolled in a coaching class. After Mains, Anand 
      <br>
      took a revision pack from 2 sources and prepared thoroughly for the JEE advanced. <br>
      Anand confesses that he was weak in Chemistry. He always paid special attention to both organic and inorganic 
      <br>
      chemistry. Anand not only topped with rank 3 in JEE Advanced, but also scored 94.4% marks in his Class 12 
      <br>
      board exams.</p>
      <h3>Kartikeya Gupta </h3>
      <p>
        JEE Advanced AIR 4) <br>
        Kartikeya Gupta, a Delhi boy, said that he had been preparing for 5 years for the JEE. His success was a  
        <br>
        by-product of the learning he got from his school teachers and coaching class, to both of which he is 
        <br>
        completely grateful. During school days Kartikeya used to put in 4-5 hours of extra studying, but during 
        <br>
        breaks and holidays he would study for minimum 9 hours every day.Pressure was huge on Kartikeya because he 
<br>
        comes from a family of IITians. His brother is currently pursuing engineering from IIT Delhi. Kartikeya had 
        <br>
        been an exceptionally bright student in school. Apart from being an NTSE scholar, he was the winner of  
        <br>
        chemistry Olympiad in 2012 and astronomy Olympiad in 2011. He secured 93% marks in Class 12 board 
      <br>
        examinations with 99 marks in mathematics.</p>
